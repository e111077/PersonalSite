# Who am I?
Howdy there, I'm Elliott, a ${age} year-old Software Engineer originally
from South Texas but now ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è [San Francisco](http://colors.findthedata.com/l/923/International-Orange-Golden-Gate-Bridge) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÄÔ∏è.

## What do I do?
I like and retweet cute dogs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Elliott_Marquez). üê∂

I also do a lot of front-end software development for [Google](https://google.com)'s
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) team because I work there :)

## What did I do?
I interned at [Microsoft](https://bing.com) and Google, and I did research for the
[MIT Media lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) and the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).

I also used to do a bunch of book-and-tears-learning in college at [MIT](https://mit.edu)
 and ended up getting a [Bachelors in CS](https://twitter.com/Elliott_Marquez/status/738778510341345283)!
I also learned other things there like, how to stumble in German, physics, how
to burn chicken, Incan history, and other random useless stuff; like my
concentration was in Ancient and Medieval history (_ego semper felicem esse de
historia colloqui_).

## What about before that?
Before that I went to high school and learned that I really did not want to be a doctor but
[a math person that pushes buttons](https://xkcd.com/722/).

## What do I like?
I like doggos, computers, video games, [Sprachen lernen](https://translate.google.com/#de/en/Ich%20mag%20Sprachen%20lernen),
Netflix, puppies, terrible horror movies, musicals, RuPaul's Drag Race, and men.
This is not all inclusive; please stalk me on social media for more.
